Worst case Time Complexity :

Task 0-

open() - 		O(c) where c is constant
csv.reader() - 	O(n) where n is input csv rows
list(reader) - 	O(n)

Worst case time complexity is order of n i.e O(n)


Task 1 -

reading - 	O(n)
for loop -	O(n) for each n
			O(n) 'not in' search and set.add worst case

So worst case complexity is Order of n^2 i.e O(n^2) 


Task 2 - 

reading -	O(n)
for loop -	O(n)
Rest all operations are O(c) where c is constant

So worst case complexity is Order of n i.e O(n)


Task 3 -

reading - 	O(n)
for loop - 	O(n)
			All operations inside loop can be considered as constant 
			as number is of fixed length
set.add - 	O(n) for its worst case
			
So worst case complexity is order of n i.e O(n^2)


Task 4 -
reading - 	O(n)
function get_telemarketers(set,calls) - O(n^2) in worst case can go up to n^2


So worst case time complexity will be O(n^2)
