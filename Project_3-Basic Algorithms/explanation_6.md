Max and Min in a Unsorted Array:

To find smallest and largest integer from a list of integers, we have iterated over each item of the list and check min and max at each iteration.
Firstly, we will store first item as two variables min and max and on each iteration we will check minimum and maximum according to different cases as shown in code.
At last iteration we will be having minimum and maximum value.

Time complexity: Total iterations will be equal to number of elements in the list. So overall time complexity is O(n)

Space complexity: We are not using any extra data structure so space complexity will be constant i.e O(1)
